# Furthest-in-Future-Caching-Algorithm

Implementing the Furthest-in-Future Algorithm for page caching.

## Furthest Algorithm in the Future Cache Paging Problem

### Problem Input Description
For each instance, the first line will be a positive integer, giving the number of pages in the cache. The second line of the instance will be a positive integer giving the number of page requests. The third and final line of each instance will be space delimited positive integers which will be the request sequence.

### Problem Output Description
For each instance, your program should output the number of page faults achieved by furthest in the future paging assuming the cache is initially empty at the start of processing the page request sequence. One output should be given per line.
